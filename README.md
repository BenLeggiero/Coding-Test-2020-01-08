# [Coding Test 2020-01-08](https://github.com/BenLeggiero/Coding-Test-2020-01-08) #

A coding test I performed on 2020-01-08


## `// TODO:` ##

Here are things I started working on, or intended to work on, but which are not complete at time of submission:

* Lazy-loading list (see branch [`feature/Lazy-Loading`](https://github.com/BenLeggiero/Coding-Test-2020-01-08/tree/feature/Lazy-Loading))
    * Since lazy loading wasn't done by the time of submission, the version on the `master` branch limits it to the first 100 items to demonstrate the rest of the functionality in reasonable time
    * Favoriting will need to be tweaked to support this
* Ripple effect when tapping a product
* Documentation
    * Normally, I document every single API I write. However, because of the time constraints of this assessment, I forewent documentation to rebalance the Quality-Time-Budget triangle closer to Time
