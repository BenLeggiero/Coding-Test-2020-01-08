# [Coding Test 2020-01-08](https://github.com/BenLeggiero/Coding-Test-2020-01-08) #

A coding test I performed on 2020-01-08


## `// TODO:` ##

Here are things I started working on, or intended to work on, but which are not complete at time of submission:

* Lazy-loading list (see branch [`feature/Lazy-Loading`](https://github.com/BenLeggiero/Coding-Test-2020-01-08/tree/feature/Lazy-Loading))
    * Since lazy loading wasn't done by the time of submission, the version on the `master` branch limits it to the first 100 items to demonstrate the rest of the functionality in reasonable time
* Replace `LinearLayoutManager` with `GridLayoutManager`
    * The work for this won't be too great (will swap out layout manager and tweak item layout), but I wanted to get lazy loading working first with a simple layout manager before moving to a more complicated-to-debug one
* Product detail view
    * The work for this was not started before the time of submission
